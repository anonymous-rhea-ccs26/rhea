*** August 21, 2015:

Service Pack 2 (SP2) of NOAA's U.S. Climate Normals has been released.
SP2 includes changes to precipitation, snowfall, and/or snow depth
parameters for the following 8 stations:

USW00014735
USW00013904
USW00023157
USW00003927
USC00053146
USC00195984
USW00094197
USW00013959 

Changes for the 8 stations above were requested by representatives of
the National Weather Service. No further changes to existing 1981-2010
Climate Normals products are expected.



*** August 21, 2015:

A new file has been added to the "station-inventories" directory that
contains zip code and post office names for the vast majority of
stations included in the 1981-2010 Climate Normals.

In addition, the daily standard deviation files (for minimum, maximum,
and mean temperatures as well as diurnal temperature range) have been 
replaced using the methodology described by a forthcoming paper by James
and Arguez in the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology. The new
methodology computes daily standard deviations from climate anomalies
within the 15-day window, where the climate anomalies were computed 
using daily temperature normals. The previous method re-centered each
day within the 15-day window using the raw daily mean for that day. The
net effect of this methodological change, on average, for all stations
and all parts of the year, is close to zero, with only ~5% of values
changing by more than +/- 0.2F.



*** August 17, 2015:

This update to NOAA's 1981-2010 Climate Normals replaces the hourly
normals products. The files were replaced to (1) add more stations to
the hourly product line and (2) modify the computation of the 
percentage of calm winds. See the addendum in the documentation
directory.

In addition, new supplemental products are being released, including
10-year hourly normals and air freezing index values and return periods. 
See the supplemental directory for more information and to access these
products. In the future, we plan to release various new monthly
temperature normals products (5-, 10-, 15-, 20-year averages; OCN; and 
Hinge Fit) computed using something other than a 30-year average. 



*** January 2, 2013:

NOAA's 1981-2010 Supplemental Normals were released on January 2, 2013.
This includes growing degree days, probabilities of first and last frost
and freeze events, probabilities of occurrence of minimum temperature
thresholds, and growing season length probabilities. See readme.txt and
the "supplemental" directory for more information on how to access these 
new products.



*** August 4, 2012:

Effective Saturday, August 4, 2012, Service Pack 1 (SP1) of NOAA's U.S.
Climate Normals is being released. SP1 includes the following 4 changes:

1. Following change requests submitted by the National Weather Service
(NWS), the precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth normals parameters at
83 stations were recalculated based on GHCN-Daily version 
2.92-upd-2012052822. These include 81 stations for which the NWS
submitted additional snowfall and snow depth data. The normals for the
other two stations were reissued to remedy unique issues affecting their
average monthly precipitation totals in particular months.

All other normals remain unchanged and are based on GHCN-Daily version 
2.80-por-2011052713. The stations whose precipitation- and snow-related
normals were recomputed are listed below.

Station ID   Reason/Action
-----------  -----------------------------------------------------------
USW00003017  July precipitation normal was suboptimal due to problematic
                 input data; improved by using only Denver Stapleton for
                 underlying estimated monthly totals

                 insufficiently representative input data; enough data
                 now available for computing traditional normals rather  
                 than pseudonormals

2. Higher-precision heating and cooling degree day normals (to the
hundredths place) are now provided in addition to the regular-precision
normals (whole degrees). See #4 below for more information.

3. The station lists on the NCDC FTP site has been updated to reflect
NCDC's latest metadata on station locations and names. Station
USW00092762 (a Pennsylvania station known as "Site R") has had its
GHCN-Daily ID corrected to USW00093762 recently, but at the moment we
have kept this station's ID as USW00092762 in SP1. This and other known
ID issues are scheduled to be addressed in a future service pack.

4. The "station" subdirectory under products has been moved into a new
directory called "auxiliary" which also contains a new subdirectory
entitled "high-precision-degree-days" that contains the new values
described in item #2 above. These changes are reflected in the modified
readme.txt file.



*** September 1, 2011:

In order to fix a minor bug, the following 4 files have been replaced in
www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/precipitation/ :

mtd-prcp-normal.txt
mtd-snow-normal.txt
ytd-prcp-normal.txt
ytd-snow-normal.txt

For precipitation, the change affects the average month-to-date and
year-to-date totals in one month at each of 37 stations, representing
0.03% of all station-months. For snowfall, the change impacts a total of
427, or 0.56%, of the station-months at 422 stations. Accordingly, the
affected individual station normals files have also been replaced in
www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/

In exceedingly rare instances, the month-to-date (or year-to-date)
totals could actually decrease by a very small amount from one day to
the next. This was an artifact of an algorithm used to smooth the totals
through the year and only occurred when the corresponding average
monthly total was -7777, i.e., in less than 0.005 inches of
precipitation or 0.05 inches of snowfall.



*** July 7, 2011:

A file documenting the format of the filled monthly precipitation data
(source-datasets/mly-prcp-filled.txt) has been added in the
documentation subdirectory. See the readme.txt file for specifics on
filenames.



*** July 1, 2011:

These normals were released on July 1, 2011. This includes annual,
seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly normals for over 9800 stations.

Later installments will include climate division normals, 
agricultural-related normals such as frost-free dates and growing degree
days, as well as population-weighted heating and cooling degree days.
